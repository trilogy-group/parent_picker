# Brainlift: Location Selection

**Owner:** Andy Price and Neeraj Gupta

**Purpose:** Determine if a particular location (street address) is appropriate for Alpha school

**Related Brain Lifts:**
- Building and facilities (TBD)
- Outreach (TBD)
- Transaction Economics and Leasing (TBD)

## DOK 4 - SPOV

- Alpha can convince students from any rich family to enroll at Alpha. We are happy to compete with other private and public schools.
- Alpha's brand is the most premium brand in the country ("Stanford of K-12"). Locations must be "great, no debate", so put them in the best locations in a region.
- Families will put up with tradeoffs for small microschools when there is a clear path to a bigger and better school with at least 250 students within 2 years.
- Excited families have the best local knowledge, networks, and capabilities - we leverage this in every way possible including letting them decide exactly where a microschool goes.
- Waitlists are stupid, so bring capacity online to soak up demand in a region.

## DOK 3 - Insights

- Bigger schools are better. In anything except the top 10 metros, we're only going to have a single Alpha long-term, so we need to be in the very best neighborhood from the beginning
- Everyone benefits from full schools - parents, students, marketing departments, and investors
- Larger format schools take longer to find and open than microschools, so start working on those as soon as the first microschool is announced
- The traditional approach of starting with a multi-year construction / permitting project (with inevitable delays) delivers a large empty school that takes years to fill
- Instead, we simultaneously initiate the pipeline for all 3 campuses (for 25, 250, and 1000 students) ensuring larger schools can be full on launch
- The extra costs to have capacity to avoid waitlists, whether it is earlier CapEx investment, tails of unused leases on smaller temporary sites, etc. are almost always outweighed by financial benefit of enrolled students

### Key Factors for Locations

- **Proximity to existing private schools** with comparable tuition is the best proxy. It is proven parents will pay to send their children to that location
- **Wealthy families near A-rated public schools.** Wealthy families don't always send their children to private schools, they also congregate near A-rated public schools. Density of students from such schools is a positive factor.
- **Household wealth** is another critical factor. Families will spend 10% of AGI on education if there is a premium product
- **Parent feedback** on our analysis is also important, understanding that they will always want a location within a 20 min drive time of where they live
- Our analysis may very well be wrong - we are open to letting excited parents trump us if they can fill the initial microschool.
- Give parents a clear task list, and let them find solutions
- **Region definition** is critical to understanding the best areas of a city - we default to county, but need to be better. High level definition: given a location, a sufficiently large area to capture alternative locations to consider as comparison, but that aren't too far so as to be considered in a "different" region.
- The point of a microschool is to open in a location "this" year which disallows any microschool location that is not zoned-by-right for school use.
- Even with strong demographics within the target drive time, a location may be disqualified if the proximal neighborhood is sketchy, too industrial, dangerous, etc. However, this needs to be considered in the context of what is normal for that metro. Example: limited homelessness in downtown SF or NY, location in a strip mall in Houston, etc.

## DOK 3 - Blueprints

### Site Search/Collection

- **Listing Search:** Use commercial real estate data feeds to search a given market for properties, filtering primarily by size
  - Micro (~25 kids) => 2,500 - 7,500 sq ft
  - Micro2 (~100 kids) => 7,500 - 15,000 sq ft
  - Growth (~250 kids) => 15,000 - 50,000 sq ft
  - Flagship (~1,000 kids) => 50,000 - 150,000 sq ft+
- **Broker Search:** Locations are sent to us by both (a) nationwide brokers and (b) a network of local brokers who understand our search criteria and actively monitor their markets for micro opportunities on our behalf
- **Parent Search:** Solicit locations from parents and prospective parents

### Site Evaluation

The two main metrics are **Enrollment Score (ES)** and **Wealth Score (WS)**, with an alternative Enrollment Score including public schools called **Enrollment Score+ (ES+)**. We also look at **Relative Scores** for all 3.

- **Enrollment Score:** Total enrollment of nearby private schools, weighted by tuition (higher is better) and proximity (closer is better). Measures competitive density and validates demand for premium education options. Target threshold: **2,500 or more**
- **Enrollment Score+:** Enrollment Score plus an Enrollment Score calculation for A-grade public schools. We believe we can take demand from public schools at the same rate we take demand from the entire >$500k demographic. Target threshold: **2,500 or more**
- **Relative Enrollment Score:** Enrollment Score or Enrollment Score+ expressed as a percentage of the maximum score within a given region (default to county). Provides essential regional benchmarking to compare markets consistently.
- **Wealth Score:** Total number of children from households with annual income exceeding $500,000 within a 20-minute drive time. Directly measures neighborhood affluence and our Total Addressable Market. We assume a conversion rate of 10% of wealthy families in an area. Target threshold: **2,500 or more**
- **Relative Wealth Score:** Kids >$500k count as a percentage of the regional maximum (default to county). Enables apples-to-apples comparison of TAM potential across different metros and submarkets.

**Scoring Rules:**
- An ideal site has an Enrollment Score and a Wealth Score > 2,500
- If a site has either < 1,250, we exclude that site
- Grade sites on the scale between 1,250 and 2,500
- For Relative scores, we ideally want both relative scores over 75%
- Anything below 25% is rejected
- Grade on the scale between 25%-75%

### Zoning

- **Microschools (2,500 to 7,500 sq ft):** We only accept zoning where schools are permitted by right, or the rare cases where a city has no zoning laws whatsoever (e.g. Houston, TX)
- **Larger schools:** We prefer zoning where schools are permitted by right, but we also accept locations where schools require a conditional use permit (CUP) or special use permit (SUP)
- **All schools:** We do not accept sites that require a zoning change because school use is prohibited

### Parent Override

Blueprint for when parents can trump our location decision:

**Microschools:**
- If anywhere in the region works on the quantitative demographic analysis, then parent needs to fill 25 students
- If nowhere in the region works on the quantitative demographic analysis, the parent needs to help with R/E and students:
  - "My minimum viable school is ~100 kids. I don't think your city can support that."
  - "I want to make this work for you. If you can get me space for 50 (at your expense) and fill 25 kids for year 1, we will open the school."
  - "If we end up with demand over 50, we'll take the next steps on our own."

**Growth and Larger:** Out of scope for now.
